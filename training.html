        <h3>Puppy Grooming</h3>
        Puppy grooming is an important part of owning a dog. It helps to keep your puppy healthy, comfortable, and
        looking their best. There are a few different things you can do to groom your puppy at home, including:
        <ul>
          <strong>Brushing:</strong> Brushing your puppy's coat helps to remove dead hair, dirt, and mats. It also helps to distribute natural oils throughout the coat, which keeps it healthy and shiny.<br>
          <strong>Bathing:</strong> Bathing your puppy helps to remove dirt, debris, and any harmful bacteria or parasites. It's important to use a shampoo that is specifically designed for dogs, as human shampoos can be harmful to their skin.<br>
          <strong>Nail trimming:</strong> Puppy nails can grow quickly and become sharp. If they're not trimmed regularly, they can scratch you or your furniture. You can use a pair of dog nail clippers to trim your puppy's nails.<br>
          <strong>Ear cleaning:</strong> Puppies' ears can get dirty and clogged with wax. This can lead to ear infections. You can clean your puppy's ears with a cotton ball and a mild ear cleaning solution.<br>
          <strong>Dental care:</strong> Puppies need to have their teeth brushed regularly, just like humans. You can use a soft-bristled toothbrush and dog toothpaste to brush your puppy's teeth.<br>
        </ul>
